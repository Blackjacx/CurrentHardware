# Current Hardware
Shows the evolution of my current hardware for professional and private development 👨‍💻

I use this project to maintain the specs of my computing hardware. The files are named after specific models I own. If any of my hardware receives an upgrade I will also commit new specs. So every commit will represent a new hardware upgrade. 

This way of maintaining devices is extremely helpful for e.g. filing bug reports or asking questions on StackOverflow, etc. 

I hope that helps some folks to organize themselves. 

Any inspiration for improvement is very welcome.

Have a nice time and cheers 🥃
